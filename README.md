# Node-RED-Visual-recognition-Intro


<hr>

## Introduction

With this project, you can quickly build a Node-RED Starter app and use one of the Watson cognitive service. You will use Watson Visual Recognition. 
It is just an introduction to Node-RED and Watson, very simple, but this will get you an idea on how to use it.

* __Note__: All services used in this repo are Lite plans. Don't forget to star this repo if you like it.
* Use Firefox or Chrome for better performance


## Tutorial steps

To create your AI powered application, you must first deploy a Node-RED-starter application. Then you need the Watson Visual Recognition service  to this Node-RED application. 

Here a short [presentation](steps/presentation.pdf) of the components which you will make use of.


* Step 1 - [Create a Node-RED application and connect a Visual Recognition service.](nodered.md)
* Step 2 - [Install extra nodes.](extranode.md)
* Step 3 - [Build the flow and do some configuration.](flow.md)
* Step 4 - [Finished! Test and play with your flow](play.md)
